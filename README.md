# AI-Enhanced Drug Information Publishing Platform

This repository contains a skeletal implementation for an interview exercise. The goal is to build a production ready system that transforms FDA drug label JSON files into SEO-optimized web pages with the help of AI services.

## Quick Start (under 5 minutes)

1. Install **Node.js 18+**, **Docker**, and **docker-compose**.
2. Clone this repository.
3. From the project root run:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

4. Access the application at `http://localhost:3000`.

> **Note**: The current repository contains only placeholder code. Replace the service implementations and configuration to suit your environment.

## Architecture Overview

The platform is designed as a full-stack application using the following components:

- **Next.js 14+** – Renders drug information pages, performs SEO optimization, and provides the user interface.
- **NestJS** – Serves as the backend API, processes label data, and exposes an MCP interface.
- **Python** – Optional scripts for data processing and analysis.
- **Database** – Stores processed FDA drug label data and AI-enhanced content.
- **Docker** – Provides a containerized deployment via `docker-compose`.

### Core Workflow

```
FDA Label JSON → Data Processing → AI Content Enhancement → SEO-Optimized Pages
```

A data processing pipeline parses each label file, extracts key information, and sends it through AI services for enhanced content generation. The output is then stored in a database and served to the Next.js frontend.

## AI Integration Decisions

- **Service Choice**: `TODO: specify (e.g., OpenAI, Claude)` – pick an API that balances cost, reliability, and medical accuracy.
- **Reliability**: Implement retries and fallbacks when AI calls fail. Validate generated text before publishing.
- **Prompting Strategy**: Craft prompts specifically for medical content to minimize hallucinations. See `/docs` for drafting ideas.
- **MCP Implementation**: Expose drug information and AI tools using the Model Context Protocol.

## SEO Optimization Approach

- Server-side render all drug pages for optimal indexing.
- Generate meta tags and structured data for each drug.
- Maintain a clean URL structure (`/drugs/drug-name`).
- Optimize Core Web Vitals by minimizing client-side JavaScript.
- Create internal links among related drugs and conditions.

## Performance and Caching

- Cache processed label data to reduce AI API calls and improve page load times.
- Implement database indices for quick retrieval.
- Handle AI API rate limits gracefully and log failures for review.

## Known Limitations & Future Work

- The repository currently contains minimal implementation. Key features like AI requests, data models, and a working database are incomplete.
- Further work is required on automated testing and CI configuration.
- Additional effort is needed to ensure medical accuracy and regulatory compliance before production use.
